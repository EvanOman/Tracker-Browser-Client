# Tracker-Browser-Client

Tracker is a free video analysis and modeling tool designed to be used in physics education. Tracker video modeling is a powerful way to combine videos with computer modeling based on the Open Source Physics (OSP) Java framework. For more information, see the official Tracker website.

Tracker Web Client is an Open Source project I undertook with Chris Harman during our time at Edmentum. It allows for the viewing of the original Tracker program files to be achieved through a web browser, rather than through a stand-alone application. It requires no flash or browser plugins of any kind, as it is all written in HTML5 and Javascript. By modeling a track’s position as it moves across the screen, it is able to calculate more than twenty mathematical properties, such as the object’s velocity, acceleration, momentum, angular velocity and more. These parameters are view-able through interactive plots and tables which are linked to video play-through, allowing students to view all these properties in real time as the video progresses.
